# ML-Heathcare-Web-App
This is a interactive Machine Learning Web App <b><i>"ML in Healthcare"</i></b> developed using Python and StreamLit. It uses algorithms like Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost to build powerful and accurate models to predict the risk (High / Low) of the user to having an Heart Attack, or Breast Cancer based on the user's specific attributes, most common of them being like age, sex, heart-rate, sugar etc.

This applications has two basic sections:

<h2>1) - Model Building </h2>
In this section 7 different ML models are built using different algorithms. The models are trained using datasets from [UCI Machine Learning Repo](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
