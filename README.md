# ML-Heathcare-Web-App
This is a interactive Machine Learning Web App <b><i>"ML in Healthcare"</i></b> developed using Python and StreamLit. It uses ML algorithms to build powerful and accurate models to predict the risk (High / Low) of the user to having an Heart Attack, or Breast Cancer based on the user's specific attributes, most common of them being like age, sex, heart-rate, sugar etc.

This applications has two basic sections:

<h2>1) - Model Building </h2>
In this section 7 different ML models are built using different algorithms. The models used are: 

```
Logistic Regression 
KNN 
SVM 
Decision Trees 
Random Forest 
Gradient Boosting 
XGBoost
```
The models are trained using data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php, particularly the [Heart Attack Prediction](https://github.com/advikmaniar/ML-Heathcare-Web-App/blob/main/Data/heart.csv) and [Breast Cancer (Wisconsin) Dataset]()
