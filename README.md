# ML-Heathcare-Web-App
This is a interactive Machine Learning Web App ("ML in Healthcare") developed using Python and StreamLit. It uses algorithms like Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost to build powerful and accurate models to predict the status of the user (High Risk / Low Risk) with respect to Heart Attack and Breast Cancer.


This applications has two basic sections:
<h2>1) - Model Building Section </h2>
In this section 7 different ML models are built using different algorithms
